# TG_Redash_Interview_Demo
The project is a live-streaming fraud dashboard that utilizes data from the fraud starter kit from TigerGraph. This project was created for the presentation round of my interview for TigerGraph. 

The main components of this project are:
1. [Redash](https://redash.io/) - for dashboarding
2. [TigerGraph](https://www.tigergraph.com/) - graph database with connected fraud data
3. TigerFlow ([NodeRed](https://nodered.org/)) - flow editor for configuring streaming of data
4. [tgSolutionPack](https://github.com/TigerGraph-DevLabs/tgSolutionPack) - an open-source project from TigerGraph with scripts and data for installing the starter kits

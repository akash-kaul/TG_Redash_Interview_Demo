# TG_Redash_Interview_Demo
The project is a live-streaming fraud dashboard that utilizes data from the fraud starter kit from TigerGraph. This project was created for the presentation round of my interview for TigerGraph. 

The main components of this project are:
1. [Redash](https://redash.io/) - for dashboarding
2. [TigerGraph](https://www.tigergraph.com/) - graph database with connected fraud data
3. TigerFlow ([NodeRed](https://nodered.org/)) - flow editor for configuring streaming of data
4. [tgSolutionPack](https://github.com/TigerGraph-DevLabs/tgSolutionPack) - an open-source project from TigerGraph with scripts and data for installing the starter kits

# Getting Started
This project offers two solutions. One is a fraud dataset with custom queries and other features. There are also instructions below to create a simple fraud dashboard with data streaming using Redash and Node Red. The other is a general insallation using the `tgSolutionPack` project. Using this you can install any of 10 different starter kits, and still contains the blank dashboard template to create your own custom projects.

See below for instructions of the respective solutions.
